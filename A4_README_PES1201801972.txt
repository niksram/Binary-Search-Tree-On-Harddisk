Key Takeaways:

    We can impart both the benefits of linearly grouped elements (array) as well as dynamically allocated memory (linked lists) 
    to seamlessly insert and delete elements without affecting other elements relative location.

    Directly dumping as well as extracting data elements into binary file without converting it into human understandable format.

    Using required instance of data directly from file when required instead of reading the entire file and clogging lot of run-time memory.
    Hence writing it immediately to file after modification.

    The concept of pointers pointing to a particular memory location don't make sense outside the scope of a run-time of a program hence
    offsets must be used in order to preserve the relative position.

Notes:

    when only left or right child exists for the node to be deleted, the single child is pushed up to the location of the deleted node.
    
    when both the child exists, then the in-order successor is computed and put at the deleted nodes location.
